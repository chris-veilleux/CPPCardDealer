# CPPCardDealer
Card Dealer is an object-oriented, console-based program written in C++. When run, the program simulates the shuffling of a deck of cards,
then asks the user how many cards they would like before dealing them out.

Using classes, functions, header files, and exception handling, the output of this program is designed to be as user-friendly as possible.
The program will not accept invalid outputs and will continue to prompt the user for valid inputs until they are provided.
See screenshot below.

This program was written for Assignment 2 in Introduction to C++.
